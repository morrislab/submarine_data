# Simulated data with noise

Each folder contains 1800 simulations based on the noise-free simulations without CNAs. 
Each of these simulations is represented with two frequency files.
Once where the subclone IDs match those in the noise-free data, e.g. `sim_K20_N10_T100_run10.freq`, and once where these IDs match the ordering 
of the subclones in the noise-free subMAR, e.g. `sim_K20_N10_T100_run10_ordered.freq`.
Note, that the noise-free subMARs were constructed with an earlier version of SubMARine that sorted subclones in decreasing order according 
to the subclonal frequency in the first sample.
